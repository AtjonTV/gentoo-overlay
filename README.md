# Private Gentoo Overlay

This is my private Gentoo Overlay and is not indented to
be added by others. I used the generic name `localrepo`
for that purpose and also disabled auto sync.

Some ebuilds are hacks and only work on my machine to
just get the software installed and tracked by portage
for easily removal and upgrades.

You are free to take all ebuilds and copy them to your
own local repo. There is no license or anything :)

Use all ebuilds at your own risk. I'm not responsible if
you brick your Gentoo install. Pay attention to eventual
notes I have added to individual ebuilds.
